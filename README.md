## $ whoami

Hi, my name is Yash Walia and I welcome you to my little
[corner on the internet](https://ywalia01.netlify.app/). This website is built using [React](https://reactjs.org/) library

## $ make

1. Clone the repository using `https://github.com/ywalia01/ywalia01.github.io.git`

2. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies for the application.

3. Run `npm start` to start the development server at `http://localhost:3000`.

4. Run `npm run build` to build the static page for deployment.

## $ chown <your name> portfolio

If you like the portfolio, please give it a :star: and if you want to copy it,
please feel free to do so. I will list down the steps for the same.

1. Fork the repository in your GitHub account. This will make a copy of my repository and you will be able to edit it.

2. You can change the color scheme to your own liking by simply changing the values of the color variables at the beginning of [App.css](src/components/css/App.css).

3. Edit the variables and logos to suit your needs in [data.js](src/data.js) according to your profile.

4. If you are changing the variable names, please change it in the corresponding file where they are imported as well. You can simply `grep` over the whole codebase or if you are using VSCode, they have a good search functionality.

5. Change content in meta tags in [index.html](index.html) so that search engines know that it is your website. Feel free to add configuration for your preferred search engines. Please make a PR if you feel like :smile:.

6. Replace `ill.png` in `src/components/img` with an illustration of your liking or your own photo (preferably rounded). Make sure to rename it as `ill.png` only.

7. Obviously, you are not restricted to the above edits. Feel free to play around with the code and add or remove features and make it personalized. If you think, you can add a great feature in the application, don't hesitate to send a pull request or even opening an issue. I will be happy to review it :relieved:.
